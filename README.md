# Semester-Exam-Calculator
This is  a calculator that takes your final of your starting quarter and your final of your ending quarter and tells you how much you need to get on your Final Exam to get the grade you desire.
I currently go to Shadow Ridge HighSchool and we use a .425 for 1st qaurter and a .425 for second quarter and then a .15 for final exam so those are the constanst variables that can be changed within the file and this is a pretty basic program that is just meant to serve as a check
